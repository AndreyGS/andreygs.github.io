# 🚀 A few words about Me

## My IT origins

I've been interested in computers and information technologies since childhood. However, for various reasons I did not start programming for a long time. But, one day I needed to create a small database using MS Access. And in the process of working on it, I got acquainted with programming in general and with SQL and Visual Basic in particular. Then I realized that I wanted to do programming professionally. After a while, I sat down to study textbooks and since then I have been programming almost every day. I spent some time trying to choose a language that suits my interests. I managed to try Javascript, Java and Python before my close acquaintance with C, and then C++. It is these languages and the opportunities they provide that have become the most interesting for me. Along with the languages themselves, I began to study system programming for Windows. At the very first interview, I got a job as a C++ programmer.

Company I joined is a leading service provider at system programming and security. A large stack of technologies provided the opportunity to work with a variety of components - from applications, installers, services, to drivers and OS loaders. It's not that I became a supreme expert in all these areas, but I managed to work with each of these parts. In addition, I spent some time working on pipelines designed to build our product.

After a little more than 2 years of development, I was promoted to lead programmer. Soon I started conducting interviews and became the deputy of my team lead.

## Personal projects

One of my first projects here on GitHub was about simulating a math coprocessor to raise an arbitrary real number to an arbitrary real power using only summation, inversion, and shift operations. I remembered from my school days that all basic math operations on binary numbers can be expressed through them. And after a while I was able to achieve accuracy of up to **+-1** least significant bit relative to the hardware reference (numbers for reconciliation were in the IEEE754 double-precision format). [The original implementation of this math lib](https://github.com/AndreyGS/MinimalMath) was done on Java, but later I made [the new and improved lib version](https://github.com/AndreyGS/CMinimalMath) on C.

For a long time I was interested in the topic of cryptography - how encryption works, the basic principles of cryptographic algorithms and for a better understanding of it I decided to create [my own small lightweight cryptographic library](https://github.com/AndreyGS/CryptoLib) using C and assembler with the implementation of some popular algorithms (DES, 3DES, AES, SHA, HMAC, etc.), including the AES-NI (hardware-based implementation of AES for x86 and amd64).

I was also interested in serialization and developed [my own binary serialization protocol and implementing it on C++](https://github.com/AndreyGS/common_serialization). It's still under development, however, but the protocol description and the main algorithmic part as well have been implemented. It remains to finish unit testing and add some additional classes replacing std ones.

You can view these repositories and my other projects [here](https://github.com/AndreyGS). 

Also, back in 2019, I wrote [few articles on Javascript on Habr.com](https://habr.com/ru/users/ukbpyh/publications/articles).

## Priorities

In conclusion, I want to say that I like working with tasks of a wide variety of classes - from low-level to the highest-level/architectural ones. I am interested in learning concepts, protocols, systems, as well as creating my own. At the same time, I also like working with people and organizing business processes.

## Aside from programming

At the end of such pages, it is customary to talk about hobbies, right?

Well, I like to read, and the set of genres is quite diverse, but most of all I like books with a philosophical bent and science fiction. On weekends, I try to walk to new places, especially where there is beautiful nature and architecture. I do not deny myself attending events with live music, I especially like jazz. The list does not end there, but you should not tell everything at once - it will not be interesting later.
