## ðŸš€ A few words about Me

I have been interested in computers and information technology since childhood. However, for a long time I did not start programming for various reasons. But, one day I needed to create a small database using MS Access. And in the process of working on it, I got acquainted with programming in general and with SQL and Visual Basic in particular. Then I realized that I wanted to do programming professionally. After a while, I sat down to study textbooks and since then I have been programming almost every day. I spent some time trying to choose a language that suits my interests. I managed to try Javascript, Java and Python before my close acquaintance with C, and then C++. It is these languages and the opportunities they provide that have become the most interesting for me. Along with the languages themselves, I began to study system programming for Windows. At the very first interview, I got a job as a C++ programmer.

The direction of the company's activities - system programming and security. A large stack of technologies provided the opportunity to work with a variety of components - from applications, installers, services, to drivers and OS loaders. It's not that I became a supreme expert in all these areas, but I managed to work with each of these parts. In addition, I spent some time working on pipelines designed to build our product.

After a little more than 2 years of development, I was promoted to lead programmer. Soon I started conducting interviews and became the deputy of my team lead.

...

All this time, I continued to additionally learn new technologies and develop in areas independent of work. I was interested in encryption, how it works, the basic principles, and I made [a small library](https://github.com/AndreyGS/CryptoLib) with the implementation of some popular algorithms (DES, 3DES, AES, SHA, HMAC, etc.), including the AES-NI (hardware-based implementation of AES for x86 and amd64).

I was also interested in serialization and developed my own binary serialization protocol, implementing it in C++. [This project](https://github.com/AndreyGS/common_serialization) is still under development, however, the protocol description as well as the main algorithmic part have been implemented. It remains to finish unit testing, as well as add some additional classes instead of classes from std.

You can view these repositories, as well as my earlier projects, on the github resource (https://github.com/AndreyGS). 

Also, back in 2019, I wrote several articles on Javascript on Habr.com (https://habr.com/ru/users/ukbpyh).

...

In conclusion, I want to say that I like working with tasks of a wide variety of classes - from low-level to the highest-level/architectural ones. I am interested in learning concepts, protocols, systems, as well as creating my own. At the same time, I also like working with people and organizing business processes.
